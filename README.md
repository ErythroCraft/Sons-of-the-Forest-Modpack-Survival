# Sons Of The Forest ModPack - Survival
Best mods in one pack without modloader installation (Direct Installation)

Please keep in mind!
The modpack ["SonsoftheForestModpack-BepInEx"](https://github.com/ErythroCraft/SonsoftheForestModpack-BepInEx) is current and also playable in the new version. 
Sons-of-the-Forest-Modpack-Survival is one of three new editions and not compatible with BepInEx yet. 
The difference is using the RedLoader and RedNodeEditor instead of BepInEx.
