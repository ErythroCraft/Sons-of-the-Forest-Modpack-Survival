# Sons Of The Forest ModPack Survival
Best mods in one pack without modloader installation (Direct Installation)

Please keep in mind!
The modpack ["SonsoftheForestModpack-BepInEx"](https://github.com/ErythroCraft/SonsoftheForestModpack-BepInEx) is current and also playable in the new version. 
Sons-of-the-Forest-Modpack-Survival is one of three new editions and not compatible with BepInEx yet. 
The difference is using the RedLoader and RedNodeEditor instead of BepInEx.

Sons-of-the-Forest-Modpack-Survival:

## There five big updates in this mod pack:

1. Simple and editable option to resetting killed/died Kelvin and Virginia by setup keys.
2. You can now save, load and share buildings/blueprints with other players.
3. Chat-GBT for Kelvin.
4. An airplane and other surprises make the game even more interesting.
5. Creating mods by your self. (requered software)
