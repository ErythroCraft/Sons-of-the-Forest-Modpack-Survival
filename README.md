Instructions and list you can find on [Wiki](https://github.com/ErythroCraft/Sons-of-the-Forest-Modpack-2.0/wiki) pages.


    Please keep in mind!
    The modpack ["SonsoftheForestModpack-BepInEx"](https://github.com/ErythroCraft/SonsoftheForestModpack-BepInEx) 
    is current and also playable in the new version. 
    Sons-of-the-Forest-Modpack-Survival is one of three new editions and not compatible with BepInEx yet. 
    The difference is using the RedLoader and RedNodeEditor instead of BepInEx.


Good luck and have fun.
